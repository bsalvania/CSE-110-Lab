## Who I am

Hey there, my name is **Brevin Gabriel Salvania** and I go by **Gabe**. 
>I'm a *second year* majoring in *computer science*.

My first experience with programming was in my last year of high school, where I took `AP Computer Science Principles`. I got interested in programming after that so I decided that my major would be CS in college. Most of my programming experience comes from all the classes I have taken for my major up until now so I am looking forward to learning more from this class.
### Things I enjoy doing
- Going on walks
- Playing video games on my pc and switch
- Go fishing with my uncle
